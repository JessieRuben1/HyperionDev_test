# How to run code
Make sure you have python installed on your computer, if not you can install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
Once you have python installed, you can run the code on an IDE of your choice. 
The code will run if you enter a number from 0 to 9999.
The code will also run if the numbers 10000 to 19000 are entered. 
Due to time limit I could not complete the code. 

# Worst-case space complexity 
Because of there are many ways you can work out the code, coming up with one that is not just brute force coding
as well as long is a challenge. Thinking of all the ways the digits can combine especially onnce the number enters 
the ten thounds range and beyond, it becomes clear that the solution will need to be thoroughly thought out and understood.
